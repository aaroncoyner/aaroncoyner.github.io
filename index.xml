      <description>Acknowledgements This tutorial was ported to R from Amber Lin’s tutorials for PHPM 524: Introduction to Biostatistics at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University.
 Overview This tutorial provides an introduction to t-tests. A study by Goran et.al (1996) examined the accuracy of some widely used body-composition techniques for children using three different methods: dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) technique, skin-fold thickness, and bioelectric resistance. Subjects were children between 4 and 10 years old.</description>

 Overview This tutorial provides an introduction to non-parametric tests.
Data Set 1: “These data appeared in a paper which reported the carbon monoxide transfer factor levels in seven smokers with chicken pox with a view to determining their risk of contracting pneumonia. The measurements were taken on entry to hospital and one week after admission.</description>

      <title>R Tutorial: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)</title>
      <link>https://aaroncoyner.github.io/posts/r_tutorial_anova/</link>

 Overview This tutorial provides an introduction to the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The data set we will use contains serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) from samples of adult males who are non-smokers, light smokers, moderate smokers, and heavy smokers. We will assess whether these data provide sufficient evidence to indicate that the four populations differ with respect to mean serum concentration of HDL-C.</description>

      <description>Aaron is a National Library of Medicine Pre-doctoral Fellow studying Bioinformatics and Computational Biomedicine at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University (OHSU). He works closely with the i-ROP Consortium studying retinopathy of prematurity. His dissertation work centers around the implementation and use of machine learning algorithms, specifically deep learning, for retinal fundus image quality assessment and abnormal pathological findings for telemedicine applications.
Prior to beginning his PhD, he received his Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry from Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, WA.</description>
